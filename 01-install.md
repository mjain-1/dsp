# Install software on your computer


### Install [git](http://git-scm.com/).

You have it installed if you can run `git --version` at the command
line and get output like `git version 2.3.5`.


### Install [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads).

There are two things you can verify to check your install.

First, from the command line, all of the following should start up
some kind of Python interpreter:

```bash
python
ipython
ipython notebook
spyder
```

Second, inside any of those Python interpreters, you should be able to
do all of these without error:

```python
import numpy
import scipy
import matplotlib
import pandas
import statsmodels
import sklearn
```

### Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) on Mac

If you use a Mac, install Homebrew if you don't
have it yet. You could use Homebrew to manage your `git` and `python`
installs as well, but the methods given above are very good and more
cross-platform.

###Q1. Python Version 2 or 3

**Course material for the bootcamp is currently based on Python version 2.7. Students have the option of using either version 2 or 3 during the bootcamp, but should be aware of some differences in code between the two versions.**  

Did you install Python 2 or 3? Why?  

>> I previously installed Python 3 on my computer for work. Research suggested that the main reasons to stick with Python 2 relate to the greater number of accessible libraries, better documentation and learning resources for beginners, as well as the fact that it is predicted to dominate for at least the next 5 or so years. However, around 80% of the major libraries used have been ported to Python 3, including essentials such as NumPy and the rest of the scientific stack, and this is steadily increasing. New features are also being added exclusively to Python 3 reinforcing that it is the "future of the language." Finally, it is considered to be a cleaner and more consistent language.

###Q2. Which Python Version Installed   

How can you check the version of Python installed if you happen to be on an unfamiliar computer?

>> On a mac, type "python" in Terminal.
